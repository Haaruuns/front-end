I started the course by reading the general course information to understand its structure and objectives. After that, I moved on to the environment setup section and followed the instructions carefully.

I created a new folder called *front-end* and initialized a Git repository inside it. Then I made a subfolder named *Coursework* and added my first file called *learning_diary.md*. I learned how to check the repository status, add files to Git tracking, and make my first commit using the command line.

Finally, I created a new public GitHub repository and pushed my local project there successfully. Now my project structure is organized, and I understand better how Git and GitHub work together in software development.

Today I continued working on the Software Development Skills: Front-End course and built the main structure for my project website. I created the HTML, CSS, JS, and image folders and connected all the necessary files correctly inside the index.html. I linked the external resources such as the CSS file, JavaScript file, favicon, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome icons. I also created the navigation bar with a logo, menu links, and a Log In button that includes an icon. After that, I tested the page in the browser to make sure all links and icons worked correctly.

I already knew how to build this kind of structure and link external files because I learned those skills earlier in the Introduction to Web Programming course. I also already understood what responsive design means and how it affects the layout on different screen sizes. Using Google Fonts was also familiar to me. The only new thing I learned in this task was how to use Font Awesome icons and include them in HTML elements. Now I understand how to import the Font Awesome library and use icon classes such as `<i class="fas fa-user"></i>` to add small icons.

After the HTML structure was well done , I created the core CSS for my front-end project. I built the main layout structure and styled the navigation, text, and images. Most of the CSS concepts were already familiar to me from the Introduction to Web Programming course, but this task helped me understand and apply them better in practice.

I learned to use display: flex more effectively to align items and organize page sections in a responsive way. I also discovered new and useful CSS properties such as list-style, which I used to remove bullets from navigation menus. Another important idea I learned was to give every image inside a div a max-width of 100%, so the images automatically adjust to the container and never stretch outside it.

The use of CSS variables was also something I already knew, but I now understand more clearly how they make styling more flexible and easier to maintain across the entire project. Overall, this part strengthened my confidence with modern CSS techniques and responsive design.

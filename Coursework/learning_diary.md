I started the course by reading the general course information to understand its structure and objectives. After that, I moved on to the environment setup section and followed the instructions carefully.

I created a new folder called *front-end* and initialized a Git repository inside it. Then I made a subfolder named *Coursework* and added my first file called *learning_diary.md*. I learned how to check the repository status, add files to Git tracking, and make my first commit using the command line.

Finally, I created a new public GitHub repository and pushed my local project there successfully. Now my project structure is organized, and I understand better how Git and GitHub work together in software development.
